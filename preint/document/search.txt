about kerberos

I managed to fix this problem.

    Install $ pip install kerberos-sspi
    Download requests-kerberos ZIP from GitHub
    In 'requests-kerberos/kerberos_.py', change the line import kerberos to import kerberos_sspi as kerberos
    In 'requirements.txt', delete 'kerberos==1.1.1'
    Run $ python setup.py install.

If you want to run test_requests_kerberos.py that is in requests-kerberos/ you need to change import kerberos with import kerberos_sspi as kerberos.

Beside that you need to change all occurrences of:

with patch.multiple('kerberos', ...)

with:

with patch.multiple('kerberos_sspi', ...)
===============
